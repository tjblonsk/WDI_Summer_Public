* The goal of this assignment is to get used to the jQuery syntax
* practice using it to manipulate the DOM

### To do:
* Write jQuery to store the appropriate items you will be selecting from the DOM into variables for easy usage.

* Write jQuery to get values from user inputs
* Write the validateName() function
* Write the validateAge(), validatePhone(), and validateEmail() functions
  * Don't worry if you don't totally understand the Regular Expression code. All of the regular expressions you need have already been provided to you.
* Display the information submitted if everything validates
* Add clear functionality to get rid of what is being displayed
