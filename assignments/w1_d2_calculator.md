Ask the user which type of calculation they would like to perform. Then prompt them for the input variables. 

Please do 8 different types of calculations, including any of the following (or additional ones you might think of). Use functions when possible and appropriate to structure your code. Check code into Github. 

- Arithmatic (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Geometric (area, volume, triangles/trig)
