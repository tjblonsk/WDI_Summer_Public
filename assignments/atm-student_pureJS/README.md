## ATM LAB Revisited

###Goal:
* The goal of this lab is to get used to the jQuery syntax
* Practice using it to manipulate the DOM

### To do:
* Replace the JavaScript selectors with jQuery ones.
* Replace the JavaScript events with jQuery ones.
* Add events to ensure input is a number (use keyup).

### Bonus:
* Animate number changes to count between the balances when they change.
* Refactor the code to include principals you learned from the todo app.
* Write jasmine tests
